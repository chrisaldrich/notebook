In her seminal work The Art of Memory (University of Chicago, 1966), Francis A. Yates indicates that this tradition in the West declined following the Puritan education reforms of the late 16th century led by Peter Ramus.</p> <p>This decline is unfortunate as there is a lot of value and even entertainment in these methods. The difficulty of returning to some of these older forms of mnemonics or even revised and modernized methods is coming up with examples that a variety of teachers will quickly grasp and then be able to create lesson plans that will leverage the power of mnemonic techniques for their students.</p> <p>The break in pedagogy is now so severe that most mentions of mnemonics I've seen in modern educational settings are viewed as one-off \"tricks\" rather than as a bedrock of teaching and learning techniques that they were in our recent past. (How our culture has managed to lose these traditions instead of the scala naturae is beyond me.)</p> <p>In the Western tradition they were one of the major pillars of rhetoric. In many oral cultures they were integral to those peoples' lifeways and means of survival to the point that colonizers over history have been known to specifically target, minimize, and even destroy the means for indigenous peoples to use them. My hope is that we might learn from our shared past and resurrect these methods. </p> <p>## Mnemonics Pedagogy</p> <p>This is where a very powerful example of mnemonics pedagogy from the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Warner Bros., 2004) may be a great illustration.</p> <p>Before we start, I realize that the idea of mnemonics pedagogy is both a neologism and a new concept for almost everyone, so let's take a moment to define it. </p> <p>Mnemonics pedagogy is the design of lessons, hopefully in a seamless manner, that combines a lesson and attendant facts with the arts of memory (in the Western tradition) or songlines and various mnemonic devices (in the tradition of indigenous cultures). It could be considered a sub-area of instructional design. In it we might hope that the art of memory serves as the bedrock upon which the lesson is built in such a way that it becomes more natural that the students both understand the lesson, but also find it easy to store in their long term memories with minimal revision.</p> <p>The design should be such that the art of memory is integral and demonstrated organically. The student or learner need not have a pre-existing idea of the arts of memory, but they naturally hear or see them occurring without the need to do the additional work of creating memory palaces, songlines, or doing numerical translations into words or images. At some point, after seeing many examples, the students will have all the attendant mnemotechniques and they'll be able to more quickly and easily do the memory portion of the work for themselves either in real time, or after-the-fact when browsing their notes. </p> <p>These techniques may already be practiced by those in curriculum and course design, particularly in digital spaces, though they may be using some \"gut feeling\" in their practice because they're not explicitly aware of our shared memory traditions. Hopefully with a stronger knowledge of the space, the instructional design may be more intentional and thus more useful.</p> <p>For those who are still lost on the art of memory portion, stick with me, and we'll explore some by example. I'll also provide some references at the end which will provide some additional description of other practices and methods which may help teachers educate themselves in these techniques and begin experimenting with them in their teaching philosophies. </p> <p>There's nothing difficult about any of these techniques; I find that they can be easily taught to even beginning elementary school students. In a moment or two, you'll have your first one mastered.</p> <p></p>","tags":["instructional design","mnemonic devices","mnemonic pedagogy"]},{"location":"Articles/Harry%20Potter%20and%20Mnemonics%20Pedagogy/#learning-to-ban-boggarts","title":"Learning to ban boggarts","text":"<p>The scene in the third installment of the Harry Potter film series which we'll focus on is that in which Professor Remus Lupin in his Defense Against the Dark Arts class teaches his students how to fend off the shape-shifting boggart. Boggarts take the form of what a person fears most. The charm for banishing them begins by creating a strong image in the student's mind's eye that takes the form of that feared thing in a silly or absurd context. This followed by the incantation \"Riddikulus\" (ri-di-KULL-lis) will cause the boggart to take the new shape and the laughter will take the boggart's power away from it allowing it to be banished.</p> <p>If you haven't seen the movie, I'm including a clip from the scene in question as it provides some incredibly valuable context. Most of mnemonics occurs in the practioner's mind, so in this scene consider the boggart and its various forms as something which is happening in the student's mind, but through the magic of filmmaking, these images can be seen by everyone in the class as well as viewers of the film.</p> <p>Those with a background in the art of memory may immediately see where I'm going with this. The remainder may be clueless--if this is you, worry not. A few small hints will speed us along and provide not only a beginning foundation on creating a broader practice of the art of memory, but the example will provide a memorable example of something that we can all see physically compared to the exercise which is usually only practiced in each practitioner's \"mind's eye\". </p> <p>Hopefully the additional creative visual scaffolding that the movie example provides will give us enough support to more easily imagine what is going in the thought process we hope to create in our students' minds. When we remove that scaffolding both teachers and students will be able to expand their learning and study practices. Sometimes it's having the ability to imagine what is going on in the art of memory that is the most difficult part of beginning to use it.</p> <p>Lupin makes a suggestion to the first student and tells him that if he \"sees it, we'll see it.\" The example is solid enough for other students to easily follow its creativity. Again, the wizarding magic in combination with movie magic allows the viewer to see physically what would otherwise be happening in each mnemonic user's mind. </p> <p></p> <p>The example Lupin provides is incredibly similar to what [[Rhetorica ad Herennium]] would suggest. The Rhetorica ad Herennium (Rhetoric for Herennius), formerly attributed to Cicero, but in fact of unknown authorship, is the oldest surviving Latin book on rhetoric, dating from the late 80s BC. It tells us in 3.22(English translation by Harry Caplan (Loeb Classical Library 403, Harvard University Press,1954)):</p> <p>Now nature herself teaches us what we should do. When we see in everyday life things that are petty, ordinary, and banal, we generally fail to remember them, because the mind is not being stirred by anything novel or marvelous. But if we see or hear something exceptionally base, dishonourable, extraordinary, great, unbelievable, or laughable, that we are likely to remember a long time. Accordingly, things immediate to our eye or ear we commonly forget; incidents of our childhood we often remember best. Nor could this be so for any other reason than that ordinary things easily slip from the memory while the striking and novel stay longer in mind. A\u00a0sunrise, the sun's course, a sunset, are marvelous to no one because they occur daily. But solar eclipses are a source of wonder because they occur seldom, and indeed are more marvelous than lunar eclipses, because these are more frequent. Thus nature shows that she is not aroused by the common, ordinary event, but is moved by a new or striking occurrence. Let art, then, imitate nature, find what she desires, and follow as she directs. For in invention nature is never last, education never first; rather the beginnings of things arise from natural talent, and the ends are reached by discipline.</p> <p>We ought, then, to set up images of a kind that can adhere longest in the memory. And we shall do so if we establish likenesses as striking as possible; if we set up images that are not many or vague, but doing something; if we assign to them exceptional beauty or singular ugliness; if we dress some of them with crowns or purple cloaks, for example, so that the likeness may be more distinct to us; or if we somehow disfigure them, as by introducing one stained with blood or soiled with mud or smeared with red paint, so that its form is more striking, or by assigning certain comic effects to our images, for that, too, will ensure our remembering them more readily. The things we easily remember when they are real we likewise remember without difficulty when they are figments, if they have been carefully delineated. But this will be essential \u2014 again and again to run over rapidly in the mind all the original backgrounds in order to refresh the images.</p> <p>Lupin cements the lesson to his students by having each come up with their own unique image which they associate with their fear. Having students come up with their own images will almost always be more interesting and more memorable in the long term than them using images that the teacher devises. While using teacher supplied images to start may be helpful from a demonstration perspective, the mnemonic associations will be more relevant, useful and long lasting if the student provides them.</p> <p>The incantation in the lesson is a logical one as \"riddikulus\" is cognate with ridiculous, but has a quirky sounding pronunciation. This funny pronunciation will help the student to more easily remember it. I can also imagine students getting some of the sound of the word \"kill\" in the middle of riddikulus, and by association they may intend to \"kill\" the boggart with its use.</p> <p>Few who have seen the film are likely to forget the worst fears of  Neville Longbottom, Ron Weasley, Parvati Patil, Harry Potter, or Remus Lupin. \u00a0 (Go ahead and try it. Can you remember them all? I'll bet you can.) They will  remember them because the images which each conjures to banish their boggart are so well exaggerated, strong, creepy, and funny. Who could forget Professor Snape in a tatty old woman's dress, hunched over clutching a purse, and wearing a vulture hat? I can almost smell what I'm sure are his elderberry wine-breath, patchouli oil perfume, and his musty stockings. I still chuckle at the concept of a monster sized spider attempting to remain standing while wearing roller skates. For the benefit of coulrophobiacs I'll stand on apophasis.</p> <p>While not as strong an association in the exercise, many viewers may be able to remember the order of the participants based on the transformations that occur to the boggart as each takes their turn. Perhaps a stronger grounding in a technique like a the songline or memory palace could have improved our example for this sort of retention.</p> <p>These undeniably memorable images we see on screen are just the same sorts of images most good treatises of memory have suggested we try imagining in our minds' eyes to improve our memories for millennia. These include the writings of Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, Thomas Aquinas, Roger Bacon, and Giordano Bruno among others. I'm sure I could also cite a ceaseless variety of elders, but the vicissitudes of orality versus literacy and the brutalities of erasure and colonialism prevent providing proper credit.</p> <p></p> <p>These writings and teachings admonish us to take objects associated with the thing we want to remember and exaggerate them, make them bigger or smaller, give them a smell, texture, sound, movement. Make them stand out. Make them funny. Make them absurd. These things make the ideas incredibly sticky. They make them hard to forget. They make them dead simple to remember.</p> <p>As students in the exercise, the creative and absurd images are difficult to forget, so they're more likely to remember the boggart-banishing spell. As viewers of the movie, the lesson works on a similar level as it makes it easy for us to associate each individual character's fears with them.</p>","tags":["instructional design","mnemonic devices","mnemonic pedagogy"]},{"location":"Articles/Harry%20Potter%20and%20Mnemonics%20Pedagogy/#instructional-design","title":"Instructional Design","text":"<p>From a pedagogical perspective, the boggart lesson is incredibly well designed because it builds the mnemonic structure directly into the exercise.

One of the earliest versions of this advice can be seen in Konrad Gessner's Pandectarum Sive Partitionum Universalium (1548).</p> <p>Zinger doesn't mention how many of his 27,000 index cards are double-sided, but one might presume that it is a large proportion. #\u00a0Given that historian Keith Thomas mentions that without knowing the advice he evolved his own practice to only writing on one side [@Thomas2010], it might be interesting to see if Goitein evolved the same practice over his 35 year span of work. #</p> <p>The double sided nature of many cards indicates that they could have certainly been a much larger collection if broken up into smaller pieces. In general, they don't have the shorter atomicity of content suggested by some note takers.

Luhmann used his 90,000 slip zettelkasten collection to amass a prolific 550 articles and 50 books. [@Schmidt2016]. Given the disparity in the overall density of cards with respect to physical output between the two researchers one might suspect that a larger proportion of Goitein's writing was not necessarily to be found within his card index, but the idiosyncrasies of each's process will certainly be at play.

These were focused more on religious topics and ideas and were often used for creating sermons as their ultimate output. </p> <p>In the 16th century, Swiss physician Konrad Gessner (1516 - 1565), building on the commonplace tradition, realized that one's notes or excerpts might be easier to use if they were cut out of their places on the page and re-arrangeable. Gessner's method in brief: </p> <ol> <li>When reading, everything of importance and whatever appears useful should be copied onto a good sheet of paper. </li> <li>A new line should be used for every idea. </li> <li>\u201cFinally, cut out everything you have copied with a pair of scissors; arrange the slips as you desire, first into larger clusters which can then be subdivided again as often as necessary.\u201d </li> <li>As soon as the desired order is produced, arranged, and sorted on tables or in small boxes, it should be fixed or copied directly.  \u2014Gessner, Konrad. Pandectarum sive Partitionum Universalium. 1548. Zurich: Christoph Froschauer. Fol. 19-20 (Tr. Markus Krajewski via Paper Machines) 3</li> </ol> <p>Subsequent note takers and composers eventually realized that, while useful, Gessner's method could be improved by using \"slips of equal size\" (thus making it easier to flip through and prevent smaller slips from getting lost) and by indexing them or cross referencing them internally. Because note taking was frequently done on scraps of paper which were often kept in piles by topic, if one didn't file or properly manage them, they came to be known as \"scrap heaps\", a phrase which has linguistically gained the meaning of \"trash\", as lack of indexing or coherence made them useless to anyone but their originator.</p> <p>Indexing of commonplace books became much more common with the publication of John Locke's M\u00e9thode nouvelle de dresser des recueils in Le Clerc's Biblioth\u00e8que universelle vol. 2 (1685) (cf. Catalogue ge\u0301ne\u0301rale des livres imprime\u0301s (Paris, Bibliothe\u0301que nationale. De\u0301partement des imprime\u0301s) v. 99, col. 192-195) which was translated with Le Clerc's Observations (Lond., 1697, Lowdnes. v.4, p. 1379-1380) and was posthumously published as the stand alone text A new method of making common-place-books (1706).1</p> <p>Using cards of equal size became more common following the \"invention\" of the index card by Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) who hand cut his own cards used and reused his research materials throughout his career.2 Of course, taking notes on index cards was far easier in the early 20th century with the rise of library card catalogs, the Dewey Decimal System, and Melvil Dewey's Boston-based company Library Bureau. Mass manufacturing of these cards improved both quality and pricing making it much easier to source one's own cards. Dewey's push for profits included expanding his library wares into the business sector, a practice which became more common after his own company adopted a card file-based system for its own office work.</p>"},{"location":"Articles/The%20Two%20Definitions%20of%20Zettelkasten/#manuals-on-note-taking-and-early-zettelkasten","title":"Manuals on note taking and early Zettelkasten","text":"<p>In addition to early popular handbooks on commonplace book methods by Desiderius Erasmus, Rudolph Agricola, and Phillip Melanchthon, which were written for both teachers and students, one can find a growing number of texts which are either dedicated to note taking practices which heavily feature slips of paper or index cards or give them significant discussion.

(We definitely see a lot of this mode online now via blogposts, Twitter, YouTube, and fora (including https://zettelkasten.de, r/zettelkasten, and r/antinet, amongst a slew of productivity writers and influencers who make a living promoting variations of these ideas.) But historically, outside of older phrases like florilegia and commonplace books, there weren't concrete names or brands for these practices. </p> <p>Compare the traditional zettelkasten to the ideas of a \"card catalog\" or a \"rolodex\". The card catalog has an immediate definition as a physical object consisting of wooden filing cabinets specifically for index cards containing information about the subjects, titles, and authors of books. The rolodex is now a generic term (like Kleenex is for tissues or Xerox for photocopies) stemming from the company product Rolodex for a previously ubiquitous piece of office furniture. Having both explicit terms for their physical instantiations and their specific uses helped to drive the ubiquity of both compared to the humble, generic card index, which while ubiquitous in physical form in early 20th century offices was never defined explicitly with respect to a specific form of note taking practice. Just as academics in English speaking countries referred to their generic card indexes, those in Germany and France talked about their Zettelkasten and fichier bo\u00eete, respectively. The linguistic shift occurs broadly with the transmission of zettelkasten from German into English spheres around the time of the German exhibition \"Zettelk\u00e4sten. Machines of Fantasy\" at the Museum of Modern Literature, Marbach am Neckar in 2013 where we begin to equate the physical objects with a particular method. It bears noting that the Marbach exhibition featured a number of very similar Zettelkasten (the physical item consisting of boxes and slips), but with a variety of zettelkasten methods, the majority of which were more similar to each other than the \"different\" one represented  by Luhmann's.</p> <p>One can't help but notice the proliferation of specific method names for slightly different practices within the now growing space. These specific names for practices literally give both a name and power to the space and help to make it grow. Some of these names include: Zettelkasten itself as a name for Luhmann's method; Smart Notes (S\u00f6nke Ahrens' delineation of Luhmann's method, Linking Your Thinking (aka LYT, Nick Milo's method); Building a Second Brain (BaSB, Tiago Forte's method); ANTInet (Scott P. Scheper's analog branded version of Luhmann's method); and even Pile of Index Cards (PoIC, Hawk Sugano's productivity-based method from 2006). The naming tends to expand here as many of these examples have a commercial need to differentiate these practices to make them sellable to a larger audience. Should one really consider it a coincidence that Obsidian is so heavily used by those in Tiago Forte's Building a Second Brain camp when Obsidian's tag line on their home page boldly declares \"A second brain,  for you, forever.\"?</p> <p>This naming craze even extends to a proliferation of names for note types within each system including fleeting notes, permanent notes, literature notes, atomic notes, evergreen notes, source notes, point notes, concept notes, claim notes, etc. Of course the power of naming begins to wane here as the over-proliferation of names causes semantic collisions and worries when these systems and their adherents talk about related ideas online in broader overlapping publics. One would presume that over time this list of names will settle down and roughly standardize around a much smaller (dare I say atomic?), possibly mutually exclusive set.</p> <p>The lack of a specific name to distinguish the methods and uses of card indexes from each other in the early 20th century further muddles the picture of their use. How does one specifically differentiate the use of a card index for business versus note taking versus a library card catalogue? The library card catalogue has a both a named object and a method (verb) and is much more easily distinguished than the card index being used for either business or note taking use, and in fact there may have been reasonable overlap of business and note taking use making their distinct uses less clear. As an example, in The Crown season 1 episode 4 \"Act of God\" (Netflix, 2016) there is a scene portraying former British Prime Minister Clement Atlee in his office in which he is prominently bookended in the background by two four drawer card indexes: one 3 x 5\" and the other 4 x 6\". Are these for general business filing use and document tracking or were they full of ideas from his reading and thinking? </p> <p>Tangential names exist for practices in the German part of the tradition. For example there is the phrase Wissenschaftliches Arbeiten which translates as \"scientific work\". This phrase arises out of Ernst Bernheim's framing of the zettelkasten practice within his formulation of historical method, or how a professional historian might scientifically approach their work. The phrase not only pops up in the title of the book which likely inspired Niklas Luhmann's practice, but curiously and even surprisingly, searching on the term within the Internet Archive reveals 106 works, predominantly textbooks in the English language, about research methods, note taking, and writing geared toward masters and Ph.D. students.</p> <p>The lack of a named method, generally makes finding written examples of these practices in the historical record more difficult as one must search for generic words (index cards, slips, notes) used within the practice rather than specific method words with dramatically higher signal-to-noise ratios.</p>"},{"location":"Articles/The%20Two%20Definitions%20of%20Zettelkasten/#relegation-of-the-practice-to-academia","title":"Relegation of the practice to academia","text":"<p>Knowledge about these note taking practices has almost always been geared toward academic settings and even there it has been primarily geared toward masters and Ph.D. level students who would more profitably use them over extended time horizons for not only their thesis work, but their extended careers.

It's only within the last decade or so that one finds general note taking advice or practices for knowledge workers or those interested in greater productivity in their work. Advice of the sort and form given by Twyla Tharp or Anne Lamott is the exception rather than the rule.</p>"},{"location":"Articles/The%20Two%20Definitions%20of%20Zettelkasten/#hidden-transmission-and-unclear-value-proposition","title":"Hidden transmission and unclear value proposition","text":"<p>Beyond the modes of written transmission of these practices and methods which have been geared toward academics, the primary mode of transmission is from either teacher to student or from practitioner to practitioner. This transmission mode is often much \"quieter\" and ostensibly hidden from historical view without significant work. There are media studies and history scholars who look at the notebooks and records of students and teachers to follow some of these methods, so some of these specific practices may surface over time.</p> <p>These \"manual\" transmission modes are \"high touch\" (requiring a lot of work) and as a result are very slow to diffuse. Quite often they fail to adequately inspire or communicate their immense long term value. In a zettel in his second zettelkasten entitled \"Does Spirit hide in the filing cabinet\" (literally, though one could translate it as \"Is there a Ghost in the machine?\"), Niklas Luhmann wrote a note about people disappointed in seeing his system in person: \"People come, they see everything [his boxes, slips, and notes] and nothing more than that, just like in porn movies; consequently, they leave disappointed.\" 9</p> <p>In Appendix C of her autobiography, Beatrice Webb found difficulty in explaining the massive value she found in her note taking practice and resorted to telling the reader to trust her experience:</p> <p>\"What is the use of this pedantic method of note-taking, involving masses of paper and a lot of hard thinking, not to mention the shuffling and reshuffling, which is apparently the final cause of this intolerable elaboration?\" will be asked by the post-graduate student eager to publish an epoch-making treatise on the History of Government, or, perchance, on the History of Freedom, within the two years he has allotted to the taking of his doctorate. The only answer I can give is to cite our own experience.</p> <p>My own anecdotal experience of research and note taking with index cards dates to 1985 when, in sixth grade, I was admonished to take my notes on index cards so that I could later string them together in outline form to create a narrative. While this was done with good intentions, there was no indication of doing this as a life-long practice nor was there any discussion of potential long term uses or potential beneficial affordances or effects. To make matters worse, my natural memory for storing ideas for a 3 page essay with only a handful of sources was strong enough that note taking seemed a waste of time. Never anticipating the need to be able to think and write over a lifetime, I filed the idea into the proverbial circular bin. I suspect this is the case for the vast majority students in the latter half of the twentieth century.</p> <p>These historically hidden transmission modes can be contrasted directly with a more public facing and readily visible transmission mode of these practices which now occurs online. Social media, blogs, online fora and video platforms makes it dramatically easier for individual users to write about and pass along their particular experiences and affordances they find in specific methods, tools, and modes of use.</p> <p>The hiding value proposition of the older methods can be contrasted with the incessant drumbeat of the value and productivity inherently \"promised\" by those describing Niklas Luhmann's system. Look at all the books and papers he wrote in his lifetime! The system explains it all! It's so simple. You can do this too!

The first instances come from the work of Manfred Kuehn on note taking with his blog Taking Note starting in 2007 and ending in 2018, though large portions are still fortunately archived on the Internet Archive. He was definitely aware of Niklas Luhmann's note taking practices and even translated Luhmann's 1981 article \"Kommunikation mit Zettelk\u00e4sten\" into English. This is supplemented on March 4, 2013 with the opening of the Marbach exhibition followed closely by the launch on June 20, 2013 and subsequent growth of the website https://zettelkasten.de begun by [[Christian Tietze]] and featuring both a blog as well as a forum for questions and further discussion of the practice. While these started a low brew of Luhmann's method within the productivity and writing communities in the mid 2010s, things continued to heat up with the release of S\u00f6nke Ahrens' English language book How to Take Smart Notes in 2017. Full boil was reached around 2018 during the COVID-19 pandemic as a massive swath of note taking applications like Roam Research, Obsidian, and Notion came to the forefront of internet culture which was ostensibly idle enough to need ideas and tools like these to fill their new found free time and distract them from their pandemic worries.</p> <p>In addition to all these applications, which could be used to implement digital versions of Luhmann's method, a lot of the hype behind the idea of this particular Zettelkasten Method (again, the one specifically practiced by Luhmann) is driven by the often quoted prolific writing output of Luhmann. It's as if no one prior to him had been creative or productive within the history of ideas. Surely his output is notable for its size, but he also had more freedom and flexibility by being employed full time as a research professor at a German University where it was both his life-long vocation and avocation to produce this output. Certainly his modification of earlier commonplacing techniques helped him along, but if one looks at the historical record, nearly every famous writer or researcher in the Western tradition had some sort of note taking or commonplace book practice upon which to build.

In index card or early zettelkasten form, this process is easier as each idea is placed on its own card and placed behind a tabbed card with a single topic heading written on it. As a result, one might have dozens of cards (generally unordered) on the topic of \"Hope\", for example, and when writing about that topic, one would ostensibly go to that section of their index, pull out those related cards, sort through them, identify one appropriate for the piece, and insert the relevant idea(s) into their writing.

Rather than indexing each further related idea, he would visit the index, find that idea and then find the section of related prior cards. He could then install his new idea behind the most closely related idea already in the system. Repeating this thousands and thousands of times creates a complex branching tree structure of inter-related ideas. Once a particular interesting branch becomes large enough, one can reverse the process and turn it into a paper or book. Traversing one's tree and its branches of knowledge regularly generates not only reminds one of prior knowledge, but also tends to generate new ideas. </p> <p>While the method is very simple in form, it can generate a great deal of complexity. One will notice that instead of having a single card index tab labeled \"Sociology\" with thousands of (unordered) cards behind it, as would be likely in the earlier tradition, Luhmann's index only contains a few links into the idea of sociology from whence things branch out into multiple directions. Thus his index can focus on the more specific to find what he needs rather than the broad. This also allows for greater levels of inter-disciplinarity across ideas which may have otherwise been split into different topic headings.</p> <p>In the near future, I expect to write out a theory of how Niklas Luhmann may have evolved his practice from the older zettelkasten practice which will surely point out a number of differences in the practices  as well as affordances each provides. While we have some indications of where Luhmann's practice originated historically, it is presently unknown whether he evolved his own practice from the prior or if someone else did that work and communicated the method to him personally and from which he continued to use and evolve it.</p> <p>For those interested in more specifics on Luhmann's practice, I might recommend the Getting Started page at zettelkasten.de, the first seven chapters of Dan Allosso and Salvatore Allosso's book How to Make Notes and Write, or S\u00f6nke Ahrens' book. Looking directly at the digital archive of Luhmann's zettelkasten can be of immense value. Similarly the digital archives of Jonathan Edwards' commonplace book (which are known as \"the Miscellanies\" rather than the traditional commonplace book) and its surrounding research as well as the digitized hybrid notebook/index card version of H. Ross Ashby's notes can provide some fabulous insight as to how one might structure or use their own notes.</p>"},{"location":"Articles/The%20Two%20Definitions%20of%20Zettelkasten/#a-progressive-zettelkasten-practice","title":"A Progressive Zettelkasten Practice","text":"<p>Using some of this history, I've previously outlined a progressive zettelkasten method with levels of slowly increasing complexity which may be an easier method for people to immediately begin working towards some creative goal without getting bogged down in the weeds. It combines the older traditions with Luhmann's traditions to provide the practitioner with a potential formula to determine the level of complexity that may be right for them. Different practices and levels of complexity can be used for different end goals. (Why go \"full-Luhmann\" when \"stacking ammo\" is useful enough and fits your lifestyle and goals?)</p> <p>Other variations of these two broadly different traditions might include keeping a traditionally indexed commonplace slip box with quotes, aphorisms, summaries of others' ideas, and even fleeting notes in one box while maintaining a more densely linked version of a Luhmannian-based zettelkasten of one's own best thoughts with refinements in a separate box. </p> <p>Naturally the methods and instantiations one could arrive at are far richer and potentially more useful and practical if one is aware of more of the possibilities involved in the fuller spectrum of historical practices.</p> <p>Editor's note: I wrote this essay of approximately 7,000 words in less than a day's work, including outlining, footnoting, and editing by drawing material directly from my own hybrid commonplace books/Luhmann-based Zettelkasten. </p>"},{"location":"Articles/The%20Two%20Definitions%20of%20Zettelkasten/#footnotes","title":"Footnotes","text":""},{"location":"Articles/The%20Two%20Definitions%20of%20Zettelkasten/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Allosso, Dan, and S.

Fol. 19-20, 1548) to [[S\u00f6nke Ahrens]]'s book [[How to Take Smart Notes - One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking \u2013 for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers]]. Just a handful of bullet points can outline the elegance and simplicity of the system. This dramatic simplicity leads to some tremendous value and complexity.</p> <p>However, in modern use as seen online since roughly 2018 on, the idea and the digital tools surrounding it, has seen some severe mission creep. Zettlekasten has moved to the fad stage and we're \"zettlecasting\" everything under the sun. While it can be used as a productivity tool specifically for writing, some are adapting and using it (and tools built for it) for productivity use writ-large. This includes project management or GTD (Getting Things Done) functions. Some are using it as a wiki, digital garden, or personal knowledge management system for aggregating ideas and cross linking them over time. Others are using it as a journal or diary with scheduling and calendaring functions tacked on. Still others are using it to collect facts and force the system to do spaced repetition. These additional functionalities can be great and even incredibly useful, but they're going far beyond the purpose-fit functionality of what a zettelkasten system was originally designed to do. </p> <p>Ahrens highlights the zettelkasten method as being simply and specifically designed to do its particular workflow well\u2014no more, no less. He cleverly analogizes slip boxes to their larger box cousins, the shipping container, and the way that that they revolutionized the shipping industry. </p> <p>In hindsight, we know why they failed: The ship owners tried to integrate  the  container  into  their  usual  way  of  working  without changing the infrastructure and their routines. They tried to benefit from the obvious simplicity of loading containers onto ships without letting go of what they were used to.</p> <p>Following this analogy, many people are currently trying to not only revolutionize shipping, but sourcing, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing as well. While this may be interesting and the digital tools might accommodate some of these functions, are they really custom built from start to finish to really excel at these functionalities? Can they really do all of them at once? While some may come close and do well enough, the added complexity and overreach of all these functionalities may be diluting the base power of what the zettelkasten is capable. </p> <p>People conflate the idea of note taking and the zettelkasten with tools like Obsidian, Logseq, and Roam Research. This is not necessarily a good thing. If they expect it to do everything and it's not capable of that or well designed to do what they expect, they're more likely to get confused, frustrated, and eventually give up. I've seen it happening more and more. </p> <p>As an example, in a book club related to Ahrens' text in which many highly educated and talented people have been using these tools and have even previously read the book, many are still far too confused about what these tools are and the value that can come from them.</p> <p>For those who are just coming to the idea of a zettelkasten, I recommend you limit yourselves to just that basic functionality. Don't muddy the waters with other productivity functions, to do lists, journals, diaries, kitchen sinks, or the latest wiz-bang plugin. Don't throw in buzz words like GTD and MOC. Stick to the simplest script for a few months and focus on finely honing a small handful of questions and ideas each day from your reading to see what happens. Write, link, repeat. Don't get caught up in the collector's fallacy by keeping and saving every single fleeting note (thought) you've got (or if you must, put them into a folder off to the side). Focus on the core idea.</p> <p>Once you've got that part down and it's working for you, then consider adding on those other functionalities. Experiment with them; see what works. But don't be surprised if those other portions aren't the magic bullet that is going to revolutionize your life. We're likely to need new tools, functionality, and a system built from start to finish, to make those other things a useful reality.</p> <p>Syndication links: boffosocko.com </p>"},{"location":"Features/LaTeX%20Math%20Support/","title":"LaTeX Math Support","text":"<p>LaTeX math is supported using MathJax.</p> <p>Inline math looks like \\(f(x) = x^2\\).
