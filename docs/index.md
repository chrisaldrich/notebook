# Obsidian Notes

I'm publishing my public notes with MkDocs using https://github.com/jobindjohn/obsidian-publish-mkdocs with a walkthrough courtesy of [Shawn Graham](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/assets/slides/jan18#/).

## Hello World!

The `index.md` in the `/docs` folder is the homepage you see here.

The folders in `/docs` appear as the main sections on the navigation bar.

The notes appear as pages within these sections. For example, [[Note 1]] in `Topic 1`
