# About 

## Chris Aldrich

![|250](https://boffosocko.com/logo.jpg)

Hello! I’m a Johns Hopkins trained biomedical and electrical engineer with a variety of interests in the [entertainment industry](http://boffosocko.com/category/entertainment-industry/), [information theory](http://boffosocko.com/category/information-theory/), [evolution](http://boffosocko.com/category/evolution/), [big history](http://boffosocko.com/category/big-history/), [genetics](http://boffosocko.com/tag/genetics/), signal processing, [transgenetics](http://www.apsugen.com/), [translational medicine](http://www.apsugen.com/), and theoretical [mathematics](http://boffosocko.com/category/mathematics/). I’m a strong advocate of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) movement.

## This site
This website is a subdomain of my primary website at https://boffosocko.com. It is intended to maintain portions of my publicly available notes which don't appear on my personal website. 

I generally take these notes by hand with pen or pencil on paper in analog spaces or with [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) in digital spaces. These are then transferred to my private [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) where they may be modified prior to being moved here for potential public use or consumption. 

Presently I'm using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as a service for hosting this site.
