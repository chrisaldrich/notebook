# [[zettelkasten overreach 202202051325|Zettelkasten Overreach]]

The zettelkasten is just that, it isn't a calendar, a rolodex, a to do list or a hammer, saw, or even a jackhammer. 

The basic zettelkasten note taking method is very simple and clear cut as originally described by [[Konrad Gessner]] in *Pandectarum sive Partitionum Universalium* (Zurich: Christoph Froschauer. Fol. 19-20, 1548) to [[Sönke Ahrens]]'s book *[[How to Take Smart Notes - One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers]]*. Just a handful of bullet points can outline the elegance and simplicity of the system. This dramatic simplicity leads to some tremendous value and complexity.

However, in modern use as seen online since roughly 2018 on, the idea and the digital tools surrounding it, has seen some severe mission creep. Zettlekasten has moved to the fad stage and we're "zettlecasting" everything under the sun. While it can be used as a productivity tool specifically for writing, some are adapting and using it (and tools built for it) for productivity use writ-large. This includes project management or GTD (Getting Things Done) functions. Some are using it as a wiki, digital garden, or personal knowledge management system for aggregating ideas and cross linking them over time. Others are using it as a journal or diary with scheduling and calendaring functions tacked on. Still others are using it to collect facts and force the system to do spaced repetition. These additional functionalities can be great and even incredibly useful, but they're going far beyond the purpose-fit functionality of what a zettelkasten system was originally designed to do. 

Ahrens highlights the zettelkasten method as being simply and specifically designed to do its particular workflow well—no more, no less. He cleverly analogizes slip boxes to their larger box cousins, the shipping container, and the way that that they revolutionized the shipping industry. 

> In hindsight, we know why they failed: The ship owners tried to integrate  the  container  into  their  usual  way  of  working  without changing the infrastructure and their routines. They tried to benefit from the obvious simplicity of loading containers onto ships without letting go of what they were used to.

Following this analogy, many people are currently trying to not only revolutionize shipping, but sourcing, manufacturing, distribution, and marketing as well. While this may be interesting and the digital tools might accommodate some of these functions, are they really custom built from start to finish to really excel at these functionalities? Can they really do all of them at once? While some may come close and do well enough, the added complexity and overreach of all these functionalities may be diluting the base power of what the zettelkasten is capable. 

People conflate the idea of note taking and the zettelkasten with tools like Obsidian, Logseq, and Roam Research. This is not necessarily a good thing. If they expect it to do everything and it's not capable of that or well designed to do what they expect, they're more likely to get confused, frustrated, and eventually give up. I've seen it happening more and more. 

As an example, in a book club related to Ahrens' text in which many highly educated and talented people have been using these tools and have even previously read the book, many are still far too confused about what these tools are and the value that can come from them.

For those who are just coming to the idea of a zettelkasten, I recommend you limit yourselves to just that basic functionality. Don't muddy the waters with other productivity functions, to do lists, journals, diaries, kitchen sinks, or the latest wiz-bang plugin. Don't throw in buzz words like GTD and MOC. Stick to the simplest script for a few months and focus on finely honing a small handful of questions and ideas each day from your reading to see what happens. Write, link, repeat. Don't get caught up in the collector's fallacy by keeping and saving every single fleeting note (thought) you've got (or if you must, put them into a folder off to the side). Focus on the core idea.

Once you've got that part down and it's working for you, then consider adding on those other functionalities. Experiment with them; see what works. But don't be surprised if those other portions aren't the magic bullet that is going to revolutionize your life. We're likely to need new tools, functionality, and a system built from start to finish, to make those other things a useful reality.

> After this morning's [[Dan Allosso Book Club#^44f675|Zoom session]] on [[Sönke Ahrens]]'s book, and in reading some introductions of people participating, I'm thinking about how we can better delineate and separate the uses cases of the zettelkasten note taking idea(s). Ahrens frames it in the perspective of reading, researching for writing, and generating new knowledge. Others seem to be bolting on other things which increases its complexity and may make it less useful by muddying the waters of the purpose.

> Some are using it as a digital garden and personal knowledge management (or wiki-like) tool. Others are moving towards a productivity tool writ large and throwing that proverbial kitchen sink in as well. Still others are using it as a personal journal and/or calendar function. These are great, but the purpose fit reason Ahrens describes is going to get lost in all this noise and then folks will wonder why they're lost.[^1]
